                And for raising issues, hitherto little discussed in the current music scene, such as indigenous people in an urban context, the rescue of ancestry, the indiscriminate use of indigenous culture and the way in which indigenous people are treated in Brazil.
                <br>
                Katú Mirim was born and raised in the interior of São Paulo. When she was eleven months old, she was adopted by a non-indigenous couple. She came to know that she was adopted in childhood and at the age of thirteen she discovered that she was the biological daughter of an indigenous father and a black mother. He discovered that his biological family is composed of indigenous and black people. His maternal great-grandmother was kidnapped from the village by his grandfather, while his paternal family has the Boe Bororo people as an ancestor.
                <br>
                Katú initially sought information about his Boe Bororo people (his biological father's ethnicity) and studied his ancestry, restoring his self-esteem and asserting himself as an indigenous Boe Bororo. The Boe Bororo people were kidnapped from Mato Grosso and enslaved in the city of Jundiai, leaving their descendants in the city.
                <br>
                Katú Mirim gained notoriety on the internet when he published a video on YouTube raising the hashtag "#indionaofantasia" opening the debate on the symbols that were used indiscriminately and questioning users if their use really was a tribute.
                <br>
                In 2017, he debuted in rap with the single Aguyjevete returning to the music scene with a song that talks about the resistance of indigenous and black people. Before that, Katú had rock bands that never left the garage.
                    <br>
                    In 2017 it went viral with the hashtag #indionaofantasia, bringing to light the debate about indigenous customs used outside the context to which they belong. Still in 2017, the artist decided to use her actions for the indigenous cause to found the movement “VI Visibilidade Indígena”, which fights for the rights and representation of peoples. In the same year he released his debut single Aguyjevete.
                <br>
                In 2018 he participated in the recording of the song “Retomada”, together with Marina Peralta and Afrojess.
                <br>
